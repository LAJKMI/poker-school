You receive two private hole cards, and five community cards are shared. Players make the best five-card hand using their hole cards and the community cards.O: OmahaIn Omaha, players receive four hole cards, but they must use exactly two of them in combination with three of the five community cards to form the best hand. This variant usually involves more action because players have more options to form a strong hand.R: RazzRazz is a lowball poker game where the goal is to make the lowest possible five-card hand. Straights and flushes do not count against you, and the ace is always low (A-2-3-4-5 is the best hand). In Razz, you are trying to avoid making high hands, so the best hand is a 5-4-3-2-A. S: Seven Card Stud In Seven Card Stud, there are no community cards. Each player is dealt seven cards, three face-down and four face-up. The best hand is made using five of these seven cards. Betting occurs after each round of cards is dealt.E: Eight or Better (Hi-Lo Split)In Eight or Better, also known as Omaha Hi-Lo or Seven Card Stud Hi-Lo, the pot is split between the highest and lowest hands. To qualify for the low half of the pot, a player's hand must contain five cards of 8 or lower. Straights and flushes do not count against you for the low hand, and the ace is considered low."
